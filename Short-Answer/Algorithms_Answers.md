## Exercise I

a) The posed question involves an upper limit of n^3, but each step of the iteration increases a by n^2. Therefore, it will take n steps to complete, meaning this is O(n) time complexity

b) First we iterate on the range of n, an O(n) operation. In the inner loop we double the value of j until it reaches n, which indicates logarithmic speed, giving us a combined O(n * log(n)) time complexity.

c) Assuming only non-negative numbers of bunnies, this algorithm makes a single recursive call to itself, and reduces the remaining bunnies by 1 doing so. This is analogous to counting down to 0, giving us O(n) time
